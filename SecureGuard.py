======================
1. Identification
   - Determine if an incident has occurred.

2. Containment
   - Isolate affected systems.
   - Limit damage and protect evidence.

3. Eradication
   - Remove the cause of the incident.
   - Ensure systems are free of threats.

4. Recovery
   - Restore systems from backups.
   - Monitor for any signs of weakness or further issues.

5. Lessons Learned
   - Conduct a review to prevent future incidents.
   - Update security measures accordingly.
